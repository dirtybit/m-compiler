Building:
You can build the project by writing 'make build' to the terminal.

Usage:
You can run the project by using 'run.sh' script.
Run script takes two arguments, the letter is optional.
First argument is for filename to be compiled.
Second argument is optional and prints symbol table. To print symbol table
writing '-printSymbolTable' is enough.

Example Usage:
user@computer:~/444phase2$ make build
user@computer:~/444phase2$ ./run.sh file.m -printSymbolTable

Extensions to M Language:
1) In array assignment, different sized arrays are supported (gives warning). 
	The assignment is done until the size of array with least size.
	It is also supported for given array arguments.
2) In functions, if formal parameter's type and actual's type can be convertible, they are converted to formal's type.
3) More than four parameters to functions is supported.


Assumptions about M Language:
1) We support C-like statements by using semicolon as delimiter.
	For example,
	While 'x+3+2*f(1)' is an expression, 'x+3+2*f(1);' is a statement in our implementation.
	
2) In group variable declarations, identifiers must be seperated by whitespace.
	For example,
	var int { a b c} is a valid declaration.
	var int { a, b, c} is not valid.
We did this because, It is clearly defined in m-spec that identifiers must be seperated with whitespace.
Since there are contradictory statements about this issue, we felt necessity to explain it.

3) Our array declarations are C-like, not as stated in some of the newsgroup posts.
	For example,
	var array int a[12]; is a valid declaration.
	var array int[12] a; is not valid.
